# Wifi Throttle
This project is created for my Wifi LokRemote project (https://github.com/nygma2004/Wifi_LokRemote) so I can control my locos using a physical control as opposed to a mobile phone. This project contains a ESP32 Wifi microcontroller which is communicating with the Wifi LokRemote over wifi sending direction, speed, light and sound commands over UDP messages.

![First version](/img/throttle1.jpg)

## Main Features
- Connects to the Wifi network (AP) generated by the LokRemote controller to control the loco from a physical throttle
- Power supply is from a separate 5V power source via the USB port of the ESP32 (e.g. phone battery bank)
- 1.5 inch 128x128 color OLED screen
- Rotary Encoder for speed control
- Ignition switch which can also be wired in parallel with a dead-man switch
- Direction switch
- Keypad to active light functions using buttons 1-3
- Keypad to active sound functions using buttons 4-9
- Vibro motor for tactile feedback
- Acceleration and deceleration is controlled by the LokRemote controller

## Version History / Upcoming Features / Known Issues
V1.0
- Main control implemented: speed, direction control, switching lights, activating sounds
- Mainly designed to work with LokRemote which is configured to work with SaberTooth 3x32 controller, and data feedback such as battery voltage, controller current and temperature readings.
- Wifi connection details hardcoded in the sketch, needs to be worked on
- Create additional screen variants

V1.1
- New feautre: 4 screens created (switch between with A, B, C and D) to show all information / battery voltage / current draw / temperature information
- New feature: Auto reconnect to wifi network when the connection is lost
- Bug: headlights direction does not change the the drive direction changes (this is a bug in the receiver code)

# Hardware
The throttle is build on a custom PCB that you can order from PCBWay: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Wifi_Throttle.html.
The components used was mostly purchased from Aliexpress, small components like resistors were purchased from local shop.

## Communication Protocol
The Wifi Throttle send UDP messages to LokRemote every 250ms. Each packet is 5 bytes long. The Throttle sends these packets all the time regardless if the ignition switch is on or off. There is a response sent by LokRemote for each message sent by the Throttle. Since these are UDP messages delivery is no guaranteed, but as there are only 2 devices on the network, it is assumed that the loss will be minimal. If the LokRemote does not recieve a message for 2 seconds it will stop the loco.
- Byte 0: direction byte, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the position of the Direction switch
- Byte 1: Speed byte with value from 0 to 255. If the Ignition is switched off, the speed changes to 0
- Byte 2: Lights: Bit7: headlights on/off, Bit6: light 3, Bit5: light 4
- Byte 3: Sound id to be played
- Byte 4: unused
These messages are sent to the LokRemote IP address, and port which is configured in settings.h

The response from LokRemote is 10 bytes, and a reponse is sent every time a message is received from the Throttle. The time between each message is measure by the Throttle and shown on the screen. Response sturcutre is:
- Byte 0-1: Battery voltage * 10 as a 16 bit value where byte 0 is the upper 8 bit, and byte 1 is the lower 8 bit 
- Byte 2-3: Motor 1 current * 10 (format same as battery)
- Byte 4: Motor 1 temperature in celcius
- Byte 5-6: Motor 2 current * 10 (format same as battery)
- Byte 7: Motor 2 temperature in celcius
