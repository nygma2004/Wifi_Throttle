# Wifi Throttle
This project is created for my Wifi LokRemote project (https://github.com/nygma2004/Wifi_LokRemote) so I can control my locos using a physical control as opposed to a mobile phone. This project contains a ESP32 Wifi microcontroller which is communicating with the Wifi LokRemote over wifi sending direction, speed, light and sound commands over UDP messages.
## Main Features
- Connects to the Wifi network (AP) generated by the LokRemote controller to control the loco from a physical throttle
- Power supply is from a separate 5V power source via the USB port of the ESP32 (e.g. phone battery bank)
- 1.5 inch 128x128 color OLED screen
- Rotary Encoder for speed control
- Ignition switch which can also be wired in parallel with a dead-man switch
- Direction switch
- Keypad to active light functions using buttons 1-3
- Keypad to active sound functions using buttons 4-9
- Vibro motor for tactile feedback
- Acceleration and deceleration is controlled by the LokRemote controller

## Version History / Upcoming Features / Known Issues
V1.0
- Main control implemented: speed, direction control, switching lights, activating sounds
- Mainly designed to work with LokRemote which is configured to work with SaberTooth 3x32 controller, and data feedback such as battery voltage, controller current and temperature readings.
- Wifi connection details hardcoded in the sketch, needs to be worked on
- Create additional screen variants

# Hardware
The throttle is build on a custom PCB that you can order from PCBWay: ADD LINK HERE.
